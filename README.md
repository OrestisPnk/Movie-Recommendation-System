# Movie Recommendation System Genetic Algorithms
In order to implement a user-based(collaborative filtering) movie reccomendation system, we took advantage of Pearson's correlation coefficient, so as to compute k-nearest neighbors for a user. Then, through genetic algorithms, a movie recommendation system was implemented.
