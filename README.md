# Movie Recommendation System (Genetic Algorithms)
In order to take advantage of collaborative filtering and implement a movie reccomendation system, we used Pearson's correlation coefficient, so as to compute k-nearest neighbors for a specific user. Eventually, through genetic operators, such as rank based selection,unifrom crossover and random mapping, we could provide a list of movies for this specific user.
